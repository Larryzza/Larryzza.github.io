I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at the University of California, 
Los Angeles (UCLA), where I also earned my M.S. in Biostatistics. Prior to that, 
I received a B.B.A. in Financial Services with a minor in Applied Mathematics 
from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

My research interests include causal inference, survival analysis, 
high-dimensional data analysis, and statistical machine learning. At UCLA, 
under the mentorship of Dr. Gang Li, my work focuses on developing methodologies 
for complex time-to-event data. This includes novel instrumental variable 
approaches and predictive model evaluation in the presence of competing risks. 
I have worked on topics such as synthetic IV estimation for censored restricted 
mean survival time (RMST), interpretable machine learning for clinical 
risk prediction, and epidemic modeling.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis, badminton, and table tennis.
